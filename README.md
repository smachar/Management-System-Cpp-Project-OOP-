# Management System program (Cpp & OOP)

This project was part of a course about CPP programming and OOP design, the project is a management system of Professors and the Classes they are teaching.
The program gives the user the abilities to :
  * Add new professor.
  * List all available professors.
  * Add a new class and associate it with the professor who is teaching it.
  * List all classes.

This program runs on the terminal and interacts with the user using some predefined instructions (displayed at the top).

The objective of this project was to try to write clean code in CPP following the Object Orient Programming design.

### To run the program use:
  * `g++ -std=c++11 -c *.cpp` and then `g++ *.o` to recompile all files.
  * or simply run the precompiled version using `./a.o`
